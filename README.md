# TODO:
* TOP PRIORITY: Currently the app assumes hydrostatic pressure within the U-Tube. In fact, at the oscillation maxima, there exists a pressure gradient along the length of the water that currently has to be accounted for post-experiment. The velocities reported by the app are thus inaccurate. Taking the pressure gradient into account requires using the absolute water elevation above the pressure sensor before rotors are used. Be sure to record this water elevation, with the pressure sensor if nothing else, prior to experimental runs.
* Implement BrowseButton functionality in mainwindow.py
* Implement and test functionality allowing user to drive oscillations with periods at multiples of the system period. "targetTEdit" button
