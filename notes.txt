TODO


-Look at segmentation fault (probably occurs while writing output)

-Investigate QTextBlock and QTextCursor errors
-Fix asymmtery between rotors' power (probably due to different zero speeds or scaling) {The RPi PWM output has incorrect gain, such that there is a drift and 1100us = 1100us but 1990us = 1900us}
-Look at nanosleep
